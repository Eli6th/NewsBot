# NewsBot
Automatically sends you an email from newsycombinator and the new york times at 7 am (time can be adjusted), using the keywords inputted by the user. 

At the moment it only works with two news sources, the New York Times and news y combinator. These easily can be expanded upon if you so choose, just add an 
if statement to the parse method/def and figure out how the api works for that news source. Would highly recommend adding google news or yahoo finance, depending on your interests.

Keywords are unlimited and defined seperately, thus you can have a wide variety of topics to get your news from.
